        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
        <p>My name is NullWitt and here you can find information about me.</p>
        <section>
            <h2>Who I am?</h2>
            <p>
                I am a 21-year-old student who enjoys learning modern technology
                and improving my skills. I started my journey in 2019 and
                continue to this day.
            </p>
            <h2>What do I specialize in?</h2>
            <h3>Projects</h3>

            <p>
                I'm working on personal projects, and I think I'll share
                information about some of them here soon.
            </p>
            <h3>Programming</h3>

            <p>
                I spend most of my time doing this. Here are some languages I've
                worked in: Lua, C#, Java, C++, Python, JavaScript. Sometimes, I
                also do website layouts in HTML and CSS.
            </p>
            <h3>3D Modeling & Map Building</h3>
            <p>
                Since 2021, I started learning Blender. I've been building
                mostly low-poly models and maps, however, I've recently started
                to master high-poly modeling.
            </p>
            <h3>QA Testing</h3>
            <p>
                From the summer of 2021 to April 2022, I was actively involved
                in testing games and applications from various developers.
                Today, I very rarely do this, however, the experience I gained
                in testing helps me to this day.
